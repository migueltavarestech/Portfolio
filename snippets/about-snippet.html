          <div>Tech Enthusiast currently looking to grow my skills professionally.</div>
          <br>
          <div>I’ve always had a passion for music which brought me to London when I was 18, and after 
          a few years working part-time and doing music on the side, I got more and more involved 
          in Tech, and as my knowledge in programming languages grew, so did my passion in this 
          field. Therefore, music became a hobby and my focus turned entirely to growing my 
          knowledge in software development and following it as my career path.</div>
          <br>
          <div>In my previous position I was the point of contact between the Operations department and 
          the Engineering team, helping both teams releasing and developing new features and 
          therefore growing my understanding of programming and development roll-outs. In my 
          day-to-day I was using SQL, a lot of Excel, I was present in every Agile Scrum meeting, 
          and often used Python for automation of my own tasks.</div>
          <br>
          <div>In November 2020 I moved back to Portugal, where I intend to continue my professional 
          career in this area, after I finish the full stack development intensive course at "Academia 
          de Código" on the 16th April 2021.</div>
